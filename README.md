# CPong
Classic pong using C and Raylib 5.5. Created and developed by **[Giggly Hank](https://github.com/gigglyHank)**.

## **Getting Started**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make a "objs" folder in the same directory the Makefile is located

### **Optional**
If you have the following dependicies, you can make the project yourself.

- gcc/g++
- Raylib framework
- make build tool

When installed and ready do the following at the root directory:

1. run `make clean`
2. then `make`

Here is an explanation of the avaliable make commands:
| Command | Description |
| ------- | ---------- |
| `make`  | will compile and run the program |
| `make clean` | will remove the object files in objs folder and the program |
| `make all` | will remove object files and program, compile and run the program |
| `make all_no_run` | will execute the "make all" target without running the program |


### **I just wanna play**
Simply run the **pong** program found within the build directory.
